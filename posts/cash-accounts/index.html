Today I want to elaborate on it more. What products are available in Singapore, and why do I use them.</p><p>Cash accounts are similar to the real cash stashed somewhere and have the same characteristics:</p><ul><li>Very low risk of losing the money.</li><li>Extremely liquid, can be taken and used at any time.</li><li>No or very low interest.</li></ul><p>While providing the following benefits that hard cash doesn&rsquo;t have:</p><ul><li>Convenience. Sometimes, it is easier to transfer money online without physical contact.</li><li>Security. A financial institute or a company is responsible for keeping the money safe.</li><li>Insurance. The government often ensures that the failure of a bank or a company won&rsquo;t affect account holders (up to some limit).</li><li>Small interest. While hard cash only depreciates in value, cash accounts might keep up with the inflation.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s first take a look at what type of cash accounts exist on the market, in the order from lower to higher risk.</p><h3 id=types-of-cash-accounts>Types of cash accounts</h3><h4 id=bank-checkingsaving-account>Bank checking/saving account</h4><p>Not much to say here. Everybody has a checking account in a bank to receive a salary, connect PayNow, and so on.</p><p>Less known facts:</p><ul><li>Any saving, current or fixed deposit accounts are insured by <a href=https://www.sdic.org.sg/>Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> up to $75,000.</li><li>Most banks in Singapore pay a tiny interest on money in such accounts</li></ul><p>Few examples:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/chequeing/one-account.page>UOB One Account</a>: interest from 0.25% with minimum card spend of $500. With additional interest for salary credit / GIRO transactions and higher account balance. The cap is 2.5% p.a. with tons of limitations.</li><li><a href=https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-earn/multiplier>DBS Multiplier</a>: interest from 0.05% with salary credit + outflow eligible transactions (credit card / home loan / insurance / investment). The cap is 3% with tons of limitation.</li></ul><p>Overall the interest is so small and requires such a high balance + spend that there is no point to die-die try to earn this additional return for a majority of people.</p><p><strong>Good for</strong>: day-to-day spend. Also, some people might have spending habits to naturally qualify for higher interest. Which makes it an option for savings.</p><p>I, personally, get zero interest from my bank accounts as I transfer the money out almost immediately for better use.</p><h4 id=insurance-saving-plans>Insurance saving plans</h4><p>Some insurance companies started to provide savings plans which can act just like cash. The benefits of such accounts:</p><ul><li>Capital guaranteed. Any losses experienced by the underlying investments are absorbed by the company.</li><li>Close to instant deposit and withdrawal.</li><li>The interest rates on small amounts keep up with inflation.</li><li>Life protection, in case of death, the account value will be paid out to an eligible person.</li></ul><p>Few examples:</p><ul><li><a href=https://dash.com.sg/dashpet>Dash PET</a>: 1.3% on the first $10,000 and 0.3% after</li><li><a href=https://singlife.com>Singlife</a>: 1.5% on the first $10,000 and 1% after (doesn&rsquo;t accept new subscribes)</li><li><a href=https://www.tiq.com.sg/product/universal-life-insurance-elastiq/>Elastiq</a>: 1.8% on the $5000-$50000 only (doesn&rsquo;t accept new subscribes)</li><li><a href=https://www.tiq.com.sg/gigantiq/>Gigantiq</a>: 1.8% on the first $10,000, 1% after (doesn&rsquo;t accept new subscribes)</li></ul><p>Keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Interest rates are not guaranteed and can be reduced at any moment.</li><li>Sometimes includes additional fees on withdrawal.</li><li>Sometimes requires a small lock-in period.</li></ul><p><strong>Good for</strong>: anything that locks money for the middle or long term and requires quick access to the money. Examples:</p><ul><li>Emergency fund. Lost of income and any force-major circumstances.</li><li>Middle-term savings. That expensive vacation on another side of the globe in 8 months can bring few extra bucks now.</li><li>Money waiting for investment opportunities. Are you trying to time the market and expect another sell-off in upcoming months/years? An insurance saving plan can generate a little return on unused funds.</li></ul><p>A less obvious benefit is removing the funds from an instant, impulse access and unnecessary spending, which can happen with more liquid bank accounts.</p><p>I, personally, keep my emergency fund in Singlife. It generated $134 in 10 months. Not much, but better than nothing if I just kept the money in a bank.</p><h4 id=very-low-risk-investment>Very low risk investment</h4><p>Insurance saving plans are great but provide reasonable interest only on a small amount, around $10,000.</p><p>An alternative would be a very low-risk investment most robo-advicers offer. Such accounts invest into a set of very low-risk level funds but take smaller fees compare to investing into the funds directly.</p><p>Few examples:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.syfe.com/cash-plus>Syfe Cash+</a> - ~1.5%</li><li><a href=https://endowus.com/cash-smart>Endowus CashSmart Enhanced</a> - ~1.2-1.4%</li><li><a href=https://www.stashaway.sg/simple>StashAway Simple</a> - ~1.2%</li></ul><p>Keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Low risk doesn&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;no risk&rdquo;.</li><li>The account can still experience a loss for some time. A good recent example is Syfe Cash+, underlying asset <a href=https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/OCBSGBF:SP>LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund</a> went down from $1.649 to $1.626 that accounts for 1.4% loss.</li><li>Expected interest is calculated on annual basis and can be much lower for a shorter period of time</li><li>Deposits and withdrawals take around 2-3 working days on the average</li></ul><p><strong>Good for</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp>Dollar-Cost Averaging</a> - do you have a lump sum to invest but want to do DCA using robos? Transfer the money to a cash account, and the money can be automatically invested in small chunks over a long period of time while the rest of the amount will keep up with the inflation.</li><li>Mid-term savings</li></ul><p>I, personally, use both StashAway Cash and Syfe Cash+ for my mid-term goals. They include things like vacations and income tax.</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; Yours, Ang Mo, 2021<br><br>The content of this blog shares a personal opinion and experience.
