I&rsquo;m trilled to announce that I&rsquo;m still on track. Today I will describe my bumpy road to current milestone.</p><p>A reader with a sharp eye would notice that I stopped updating my blog in the first half of 2022. And that is for a reason.</p><h2 id=what-has-happened>What has happened?</h2><h4 id=the-first-blow>The first blow</h4><p>I don&rsquo;t want to share many of my personal details but I&rsquo;m closely connected to both Russia and Ukraine. On 24 February, Russia invaded Ukraine. There were bombs falling on Kiev and tanks taking over Kherson and people dying.</p><p>This event took me by surprise. It deeply hurt me and affected my mental state. For a while I couldn&rsquo;t really think much about anything else, continuously consuming news which would fuel my anxiety.</p><h4 id=the-second-blow>The second blow</h4><p>Western world imposed sanctions on Russia. While targeting Putin&rsquo;s regime they affected all Russian citizens, including those living and paying taxes abroad. As the result I had to move some of my equities, realizing losses caused by overall market downturn.</p><h4 id=the-third-blow>The third blow</h4><p>I had some allocation to Terra ecosystem, including a bit of Luna coins as well as UST. In May 2022 UST has de-pegged from $1 and Luna went into a death spiral resulting in both coins going to essentially zero. I never over-weighted my exposure to Luna and managed to recover most of my UST, thanks to existing early (at around $0.8 per dollar) and ridiculous interest earned on it during the year before.</p><p>Despite being hit <a href=https://kpo-and-czm.blogspot.com/2022/05/we-lost-2-million-sgd-in-collapse-of-terra-luna.html>relatively</a> small, it still affected my ability to think clearly. And with the further fallout in crypto space I managed to gamble all salvaged funds away.</p><p>I see 3 main reasons for that:</p><ol><li>My mental state, I couldn&rsquo;t handle the losses, my desire to &ldquo;win it back&rdquo;</li><li>Lack of almost any experience in trading (to the point of clicking a wrong button)</li><li>Black swan event of 3AC, Celsius and others failing which caused extreme volatility for all crypto assets</li></ol><h4 id=the-forth-blow>The forth blow</h4><p>Losses in FTX and Gemini Earn failures.</p><p>I managed to withdraw on time in Terra and Celsius cases but closer to the end of the year I was exhausted enough to stop watching the space. So far I had written off my FTX balance in full but I hope to recover at least some of my Gemini Earn assets.</p><p>While none of the accounts had any life changing money, together the losses had accumulated to up to 20% of my net worth.</p><p>Obviously it was discouraging enough to stop writing about my financial journey for a while.</p><h2 id=the-new-beginning>The new beginning</h2><p>Fast forward to the middle of 2023.</p><p>All the blows I got the last year are still with me. The war is still there, the money are still gone and there is no resolution for FTX or Gemini Earn cases.</p><p>But I learned to live with it. I finally found peace with myself. I will do my best moving forward, not stuck in the past. And there is a good occasion for a come back.</p><p>2 years ago I set myself ambitious goal to reach S$1,000,000 net worth (excluding property) in 5 years. I also planned to start my own family. And despite all setbacks I&rsquo;m still on track. I&rsquo;m happily married to a wonderful wife now. And I expect to become a father on the very first day of the next year.</p><h4 id=how-did-i-managed-to-reach-my-financial-goal>How did I managed to reach my financial goal?</h4><p>Over the years I found one of the best ways for me to cope with stress and depression is to work more and work harder.</p><p>Here is a chart of my salary since I moved abroad. I don&rsquo;t have recorded numbers for around 5 years before that.</p><p><img src=/images/salary-chart-2015-2023.png alt="Salary chart"></p><p>My current employer recognized my contributions and increased my compensation as well as, this year for the first time ever, I got large enough bonus that was able to affect my finance state considerably. Sadly, going forward I don&rsquo;t expect my salary income to grow much. I think I&rsquo;m very close to the celling of what I can make if I continue with my current occupation. And I don&rsquo;t feel like changing profession any time soon. So I wouldn&rsquo;t expect more than 20% increase (adjusted for inflation) for the rest of my life.</p><h4 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h4><p>Sticking to my monthly DCA to a retirement portfolio and additional salary income combined with keeping my lifestyle inflation low made me overcome financial challenges of the last year!</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; Yours, Ang Mo, 2023<br><br>The content of this blog shares a personal opinion and experience.
