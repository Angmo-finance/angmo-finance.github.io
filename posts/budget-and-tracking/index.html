<h1 class=title>Budget and expense tracking</h1>
<div class="content budget-and-tracking">
<p>To kick-off my investment journey, the first step was to make a budget.
And to make a budget, I needed to know my expenses.</p>
<p><img src=/images/aspire.webp alt="Aspire Budgeting Dashboard"></p>
<p>Many people out there start budgeting to solve their debt problems or to be able to save up. In my case, I was looking for better use of the cash that was hanging in my bank account. In the current reality of low interest rates, my UOB checking account was producing just 0.5% p.a. That is way lower than inflation. So, technically, every month, I was losing a bit of money. Sad.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Internet, I learned about the world of investment. But how much can I safely invest? And how much money should I keep in my checking account? My rent is $2000 and, thanks to the bank app showing basic statistics, I knew my monthly spending is around $1500-2000. Does it mean I can simply keep $2-4k and throw the rest somewhere else to earn me better returns?</p>
<p>Not that simple. I made a list of the things on which I might need liquid money:</p>
<ol>
<li>Emergency fund. In case something happens like losing a job, I can still pay rent, eat, buy a flight ticket to go home.</li>
<li>Medical bills. I have health co-insurance from my employer but health care in Singapore is so expensive. It is always a good idea to have some spare cash to pay medical bills here.</li>
<li>Vacation. I hope the borders will open sooner or later, so I could travel and rest.</li>
<li>Home maintenance. I rent, so I don&rsquo;t need to buy a fridge or upgrade the bathroom. But I still might want a nice chair to work from home or a bigger TV or a gaming console, kitchen appliances, and so on.</li>
<li>Clothing. I prefer to buy clothes in &ldquo;bulk&rdquo; once or twice per year. The cost of such bulk order with just a few t-shirts, pants, and shoes can add up to a large sum.</li>
<li>Income tax. While the tax is relatively low here, I need to pay it by myself. (in oppose to my previous countries where employers had to deal with taxes)</li>
</ol>
<p>Poof. That is a lot. A raw estimation for everything can easily overshoot $30k in my case!</p>
<h4 id=budgeting>Budgeting</h4>
<p>But do I <em>really</em> need to keep $30k in my checking account? Actually not. I don&rsquo;t need a 6-months emergency fund available immediately. Only 2-3 is absolutely fine to start with. And I can build the rest in a less liquid assets. I&rsquo;m not traveling anywhere tomorrow. There is a lot of time to save up for it. The same thinking goes for most of the items mentioned above.</p>
<p>Cool. It means I just need to <em>plan</em> my expenses. If I know my goals, I can contribute to them in small amounts monthly to reach them on time. I need a budget.</p>
<p>I remembered an idea I stumbled on a while ago that could be very useful here: Zero-based budgeting. It means I need to plan all my spendings, assign some purpose or a &ldquo;job&rdquo; to every single dollar of my savings and income and the rest I can invest.</p>
<p>Quick googling showed that the most popular app for this approach is <a href=https://www.youneedabudget.com/>YNAB</a>. They give the first month for free, so I decided to try it.</p>
<p>I used the data from my bank to roughly estimate different categories on which I spend. Then I converted big spendings to goals. This simple exercise let me finally understand how much &ldquo;free&rdquo; cash I have on hand. And seeing exact expense numbers made me thinking how I can reduce them.</p>
<p>Overall after the first month, I was mostly satisfied with the app besides some UX issues. I also could see some limitations I would find irritating in the future. Besides, I <em>really</em> didn&rsquo;t want to create a new category in my new budget to pay for it. So I opened google once again and looked for alternatives. And I found it. <a href=https://aspirebudget.com/>Aspire budgeting</a> is a Google Spreadsheet template implementing the same approach. It also has mobile apps to track expenses on the go.</p>
<p>To me, it has all the features I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>UI/UX is alright - some things I found easier to do than in YNAB</li>
<li>Many different reports - and I do like reports</li>
<li>Net worth support - without affecting month-to-month budgeting</li>
<li>Extensibility - because it is just a spreadsheet, if I need anything not built-in, I can create it myself</li>
<li>It is free</li>
</ul>
<p>Some downsides of the tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>No automatic import of transactions from the bank<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> - not a problem for me as I&rsquo;m a big fan of manual recording of transactions. It makes me &ldquo;feel&rdquo; how my money is leaving me instead of just another tap of PayWave.</li>
<li>No predictions or recommendations or any other &ldquo;smart&rdquo; features - I can live without it</li>
<li>Limited UI/UX - obviously, a spreadsheet has some limitations in terms of UX</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I do recommend trying both YNAB and Aspire. And if you don&rsquo;t use any budgeting solution yet or unhappy with the current one, I would recommend them even more.</p>
<h4 id=in-conclusion>In conclusion</h4>
<ul>
<li>I believe budgeting and tracking software is a must-have to understand and manage money</li>
<li>Goals, to which small monthly contributions are possible, is a great solution to remove the stress of big spendings</li>
<li>Visual progress on categories spends and especially manual recording of transactions make me much more mindful of my expenses which saves me an extra buck</li>
<li>It allowed me to release unused funds and find them a better purpose</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m mostly happy with the tool I found</li>
</ul>

<li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote>
<p>To my knowledge, in Singapore, only <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sg.seedly.pa&hl=en_SG&gl=US">Seedly</a> supports auto-import from the banks. The process is slow and half-manual. The app itself doesn&rsquo;t provide a budgeting function only categorizes transactions.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
