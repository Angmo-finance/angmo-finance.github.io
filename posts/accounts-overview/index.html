I also found out I have multiple goals, so I would need different accounts for different needs.</p><h3 id=emergency-fund>Emergency fund</h3><p>All starts with an emergency fund. The idea is to save some money for &ldquo;rainy days&rdquo;. The recommended amount is 3 to 6 times of average monthly expenses. For example, if I spend $4000 per month, I&rsquo;ll need $12000-$24000 stashed away. And a large part of this amount should be available immediately in case of emergency.</p><p>For that, I use <a href=https://singlife.com>Singlife</a>. It is a <em>capital guaranteed</em> insurance saving plan that provides 1.5% p.a. return on the first $10,000 and 1% p.a. on amounts above that. There is no lock-in period, and withdrawals are instant. It is crucial to mention that <em>returns are not guaranteed</em> and could be revised at any time. At the time of my enrollment, the plan returns were 2.5% p.a. but it has reduced to 1.5% since then. While the current interest rate is relatively low, it still covers inflation<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>. And it is 1% p.a. more than my bank&rsquo;s account<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><p>Other similar options currently available in Singapore:</p><ul><li><a href=https://dash.com.sg/dashpet>Dash PET</a> - up to 10k, 1.3% p.a., $0.7 per withdrawal</li><li><a href=https://vividcard.sg/>SGF Vivid Savings Account</a> - up to 20k, 1.3%</li></ul><h3 id=retirement>Retirement</h3><p>Expat life has many benefits but also comes with some downsides. One of such downsides is the necessity to create and execute a retirement plan without any help from the government. Safe nets such as pension (in my previous countries) or CPF in Singapore are not available to foreigners.</p><p>I found it is important to start saving up for retirement as early as possible. And that retirement savings is just a form of long-term investing that greatly benefits from the compound effect. Let&rsquo;s look at the example from <a href=https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/10/introduction-to-retirement-planning>MoneySense</a>, a governmental website of Singapore:</p><blockquote><p>Andy started saving $250 a month 30 years ago while Bob started saving $400 a month 20 years ago. Assume that their investments both grow at 4% a year:</p></blockquote><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Andy</th><th>Bob</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Savings per month</td><td>$250</td><td>$400</td></tr><tr><td>When they started</td><td>30 years ago</td><td>20 years ago</td></tr><tr><td>Total saved</td><td>$90,000</td><td>$96,000</td></tr><tr><td>Value today</td><td>$174,000</td><td>$147,198</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Looking at the numbers, it was a no-brainer for me to start investing for the gold years as the number one priority.</p><h5 id=looking-for-the-best-service>Looking for the best service</h5><p>There is an unlimited number of ways how to do that, but I was looking for the following:</p><ul><li>It shouldn&rsquo;t require any prior knowledge as I have never invested before.</li><li>It should be a passive investment because I can&rsquo;t guarantee I will have time or desire to manage it regularly for 30+ years.</li><li>It should provide reasonable returns. (Reasonable here means equals the growth of the global economy on average).</li><li>It should have low fees. For such a long period, even a tiny difference in the fee makes a big difference in the outcome.</li><li>I should be able to adjust the risk level as, again, it is my first investment ever.</li><li>No lock-in</li></ul><p>After thorough research, I found a <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp>robo-advisor</a> is the best fit for me:</p><ul><li>Most robo-advisors provide web and mobile apps with a sleek interface and make the process as simple as possible.</li><li>The robo takes care of fund allocation, automatic rebalancing of the portfolio. All I need to do is to set up an automatic monthly transfer from my bank account.</li><li>The past returns of all robos I have found are very decent and are able to provide 6% p.a. even for a low-risk portfolio.</li><li>There are no instruments with lower fees except DIY investing.</li></ul><p>If we get a bit more into details, robos can invest either into <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unittrust.asp>Unit Trusts</a> or <a href=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp>ETFs</a>. Each robo-advisor has its own strategy for the algorithms. They can be based on different economic theories and require a different amount of human intervention. But it is a story for another time.</p><h5 id=my-choice>My choice</h5><p>There are many different types of robos in Singapore. And I don&rsquo;t think there is any solution that fits everybody. For me, only two made to the shortlist. <a href=https://www.stashaway.sg>StashAway</a> and <a href=https://www.syfe.com>Syfe</a>.</p><p>I found StashAway&rsquo;s strategy more in line with my preferences. The concept of Risk Index is easy to understand and it gives me the flexibility I was looking for.</p><p>Syfe is also an interesting robo, especially since they launched Core portfolios. (It wasn&rsquo;t available at the time I was choosing my platform).</p><p>I started with StashAway 18% that generated me ~10% p.a. return to date. I also found I can stomach volatility rather fine and with such a long period of investment, it would make sense to take more risk. That is why I recently increased the risk index to 22% and I might increase it further in the future.</p><p>For the latest update on the numbers, see my <a href=/net-worth-tracker>investments tracker</a> page. It also contains referral links that provide some goodies.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all for today. In the next post, I will cover the rest of the instruments I use.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Here, I assume inflation as the <a href=https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/cpimar2021.pdf>change in consumer price index</a>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2><p>At the time of writing, the interest rate on the first $15,000 in <a href=https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/chequeing/one-account.page>UOB One Account</a> is 0.25% p.a. but because I credit my salary there, hitting $500 minimal spend results in 0.5% p.a. instead.&#160;<a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; Yours, Ang Mo, 2021<br><br>The content of this blog shares a personal opinion and experience.
