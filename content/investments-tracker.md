This page is updated once per month.

I track all small and large investments, split by how I plan to use the funds.

Total funds from all investements: **$55,570.33**.

Notes:
- All numbers are in Singaporean Dollars.
- 01/07/2020 - the date of the start of my journey.
- Projected return - either projected number from a service or my conservative estimation.
- Simple return - current balance / deposit
- Annual return - calculated using [XIRR](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093266) on the list of transactions and the current value.
