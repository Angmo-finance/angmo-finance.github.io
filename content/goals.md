I believe it is important to set yourself the goals and work towards them.

In my opinion, the goals should be ambitious to motivate for better results.
At the same time, they must be somewhat close to reality and potentially achievable.

I list my current financial goals in this post.

### Liquid net worth

This section includes any "non-locked" assets. Mostly they can be withdrawn and redeployed in just a few days.
In particular:

- Saving accounts
- Stocks
- Crypto

I have just started my investment journey, and I've planned my route up to S$1,000,000.

(The table updated in June 2023 the last time)

| Year | Target        | Progress | Archived on | Note                      |
| ---- | ------------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 2021 | $50,000.00    | 100%     | May 2021    | 1 year from ~nothing      |
| 2022 | $100,000.00   | 100%     | Dec 2021    | Accelerated savings       |
| 2023 | $200,000.00   | 100%     | Mar 2023    | Despite multiple setbacks |
| 2024 | $350,000.00   | 68.27%   |             |
| 2025 | $500,000.00   | 47.79%   |             |
| 2026 | $1,000,000.00 | 23.89%   |             |

I want to stress that the goals I set myself are very ambitious.
With my current saving rate by 2026, I will have _3 times_ less worth than planned.
That means I'll have to either make much more money, take more risks or adjust the numbers as years pass by.

### Family

~~I plan to start my own family by **2022**.~~

~~Not many details here as it is rather personal topic. But it will require extra expenses.~~

I got happily married in October 2022. And I'm expecting to become a father in **2024**.

### Housing

Based on my research, it is almost always cheaper to own a house than rent the whole life.
Besides, I would love to be able to modify the place I live in based on my needs and preferences. That is usually not an option when I rent.

My goal is to have my own house by **2025**.

The question here is _where_ do I want to settle down.

From a financial point of view, it should be feasible. I own some real estate back in my home country. I don't draw any interest from it, I use it to help my parents and family. But it should be possible to cover downpayment.
