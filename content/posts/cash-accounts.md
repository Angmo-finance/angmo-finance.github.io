In my previous post, I already touched on the topic of cash accounts while choosing where to keep my emergency fund. Today I want to elaborate on it more. What products are available in Singapore, and why do I use them.

Cash accounts are similar to the real cash stashed somewhere and have the same characteristics:

- Very low risk of losing the money.
- Extremely liquid, can be taken and used at any time.
- No or very low interest.

While providing the following benefits that hard cash doesn't have:

- Convenience. Sometimes, it is easier to transfer money online without physical contact.
- Security. A financial institute or a company is responsible for keeping the money safe.
- Insurance. The government often ensures that the failure of a bank or a company won't affect account holders (up to some limit).
- Small interest. While hard cash only depreciates in value, cash accounts might keep up with the inflation.

Let's first take a look at what types of cash accounts exist on the market, in the order from lower to higher risk.

### Types of cash accounts

#### Bank checking/saving account 

Not much to say here. Everybody has a checking account in a bank to receive a salary, connect PayNow, and so on.

Less known facts:
- Any saving, current or fixed deposit accounts are insured by [Singapore Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://www.sdic.org.sg/) up to $75,000.
- Most banks in Singapore pay a tiny interest on money in such accounts

Few examples:

- [UOB One Account](https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/chequeing/one-account.page): interest from 0.25% with minimum card spend of $500. With additional interest for salary credit / GIRO transactions and higher account balance. The cap is 2.5% p.a. with tons of limitations.
- [DBS Multiplier](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/bank-earn/multiplier): interest from 0.05% with salary credit + outflow eligible transactions (credit card / home loan / insurance / investment). The cap is 3% with tons of limitation.

Overall the interest is so small and requires such a high balance + spend that there is no point to die-die try to earn this additional return for a majority of people.

**Good for**: day-to-day spend. Also, some people might have spending habits to naturally qualify for higher interest. Which makes it an option for savings.

I, personally, get zero interest from my bank accounts because I transfer the money out almost immediately for better use.

#### Insurance saving plans

Some insurance companies started to provide savings plans which can act just like cash. The benefits of such accounts:

- Capital guaranteed. Any losses experienced by the underlying investments are absorbed by the company.
- Close to instant deposit and withdrawal.
- The interest rates on small amounts keep up with inflation.
- Life protection, in case of death, the account value will be paid out to an eligible person.

Few examples:
- [Dash PET](https://dash.com.sg/dashpet): 1.3% on the first $10,000 and 0.3% after
- [Singlife](https://singlife.com): 1.5% on the first $10,000 and 1% after (doesn't accept new subscribes)
- [Elastiq](https://www.tiq.com.sg/product/universal-life-insurance-elastiq/): 1.8% on the $5000-$50000 only (doesn't accept new subscribes)
- [Gigantiq](https://www.tiq.com.sg/gigantiq/): 1.8% on the first $10,000, 1% after (doesn't accept new subscribes)

Keep in mind:
- Interest rates are not guaranteed and can be reduced at any moment.
- Sometimes includes additional fees on withdrawal.
- Sometimes requires a small lock-in period.

**Good for**: any middle or long term savings that require quick access to the money. Examples:
- Emergency fund. Loss of income and any force-major circumstances.
- Middle-term savings. That expensive vacation on another side of the globe in 8 months can bring few extra bucks now.
- Money waiting for investment opportunities. Are you trying to time the market and expect another sell-off in upcoming months/years? An insurance saving plan can generate a little return on unused funds.

A less obvious benefit is removing the funds from an instant, impulse access and unnecessary spending, which can happen with more liquid bank accounts.

I, personally, keep my emergency fund in Singlife. It generated $134 in 10 months. Not much, but better than nothing if I just kept the money in a bank.

#### Very low risk investment

Insurance saving plans are great but provide reasonable interest only on a small amount, around $10,000.

An alternative would be a very low-risk investment most robo-advisers offer. Such accounts invest into a set of very low-risk level funds but take smaller fees compare to investing into the funds directly.

Few examples:
- [Syfe Cash+](https://www.syfe.com/cash-plus) - ~1.5%
- [Endowus CashSmart Enhanced](https://endowus.com/cash-smart) - ~1.2-1.4%
- [StashAway Simple](https://www.stashaway.sg/simple) - ~1.2%

Keep in mind:
- Low risk doesn't mean "no risk".
- The account can still experience a loss for some time. A good recent example is Syfe Cash+, underlying asset [LionGlobal Short Duration Bond Fund](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/OCBSGBF:SP) went down from $1.649 to $1.626 that accounts for 1.4% loss.
- Expected interest is calculated on annual basis and can be much lower for a shorter period of time
- Deposits and withdrawals take around 2-3 working days on the average

**Good for**:
- [Dollar-Cost Averaging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp) - do you have a lump sum to invest but want to do DCA using robos? Transfer the money to a cash account, and the money can be automatically invested in small chunks over a long period of time while the rest of the amount will keep up with the inflation.
- Mid-term savings

I, personally, use both StashAway Cash and Syfe Cash+ for my mid-term goals. They include things like vacations and income tax.
