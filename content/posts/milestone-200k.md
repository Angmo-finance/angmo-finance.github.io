In 2021 I set myself ambitious goal to reach S$1,000,000 net worth (excluding property) in 5 years. I'm trilled to announce that I'm still on track. Today I will describe my bumpy road to current milestone.

A reader with a sharp eye would notice that I stopped updating my blog in the first half of 2022. And that is for a reason.

## What has happened?

#### The first blow

I don't want to share many of my personal details but I'm closely connected to both Russia and Ukraine. On 24 February, Russia invaded Ukraine. There were bombs falling on Kiev and tanks taking over Kherson and people dying.

This event took me by surprise. It deeply hurt me and affected my mental state. For a while I couldn't really think much about anything else, continuously consuming news which would fuel my anxiety.

#### The second blow

Western world imposed sanctions on Russia. While targeting Putin's regime they affected all Russian citizens, including those living and paying taxes abroad. As the result I had to move some of my equities, realizing losses caused by overall market downturn.

#### The third blow

I had some allocation to Terra ecosystem, including a bit of Luna coins as well as UST. In May 2022 UST has de-pegged from $1 and Luna went into a death spiral resulting in both coins going to essentially zero. I never over-weighted my exposure to Luna and managed to recover most of my UST, thanks to existing early (at around $0.8 per dollar) and ridiculous interest earned on it during the year before.

Despite being hit [relatively](https://kpo-and-czm.blogspot.com/2022/05/we-lost-2-million-sgd-in-collapse-of-terra-luna.html) small, it still affected my ability to think clearly. And with the further fallout in crypto space I managed to gamble all salvaged funds away.

I see 3 main reasons for that:

1. My mental state, I couldn't handle the losses, my desire to "win it back"
2. Lack of almost any experience in trading (to the point of clicking a wrong button)
3. Black swan event of 3AC, Celsius and others failing which caused extreme volatility for all crypto assets

#### The forth blow

Losses in FTX and Gemini Earn failures.

I managed to withdraw on time in Terra and Celsius cases but closer to the end of the year I was exhausted enough to stop watching the space. So far I had written off my FTX balance in full but I hope to recover at least some of my Gemini Earn assets.

While none of the accounts had any life changing money, together the losses had accumulated to up to 20% of my net worth.

Obviously it was discouraging enough to stop writing about my financial journey for a while.

## The new beginning

Fast forward to the middle of 2023.

All the blows I got the last year are still with me. The war is still there, the money are still gone and there is no resolution for FTX or Gemini Earn cases.

But I learned to live with it. I finally found peace with myself. I will do my best moving forward, not stuck in the past. And there is a good occasion for a come back.

2 years ago I set myself ambitious goal to reach S$1,000,000 net worth (excluding property) in 5 years. I also planned to start my own family. And despite all setbacks I'm still on track. I'm happily married to a wonderful wife now. And I expect to become a father on the very first day of the next year.

#### How did I managed to reach my financial goal?

Over the years I found one of the best ways for me to cope with stress and depression is to work more and work harder.

Here is a chart of my salary since I moved abroad. I don't have recorded numbers for around 5 years before that.

My current employer recognized my contributions and increased my compensation as well as, this year for the first time ever, I got large enough bonus that was able to affect my finance state considerably. Sadly, going forward I don't expect my salary income to grow much. I think I'm very close to the celling of what I can make if I continue with my current occupation. And I don't feel like changing profession any time soon. So I wouldn't expect more than 20% increase (adjusted for inflation) for the rest of my life.

#### Conclusion

Sticking to my monthly DCA to a retirement portfolio and additional salary income combined with keeping my lifestyle inflation low made me overcome financial challenges of the last year!
