This post describes some of my current accounts, what is the reasoning behind each of them.

<!--more-->

[Previously](/posts/budget-and-tracking/), I have explained how I understood my financial situation and released the funds for better use. I also found out I have multiple goals, so I would need different accounts for different needs.

### Emergency fund

All starts with an emergency fund. The idea is to save some money for "rainy days". The recommended amount is 3 to 6 times of average monthly expenses. For example, if I spend $4000 per month, I'll need $12000-$24000 stashed away. And a large part of this amount should be available immediately in case of emergency.

For that, I use [Singlife](https://singlife.com). It is a *capital guaranteed* insurance saving plan that provides 1.5% p.a. return on the first $10,000 and 1% p.a. on amounts above that. There is no lock-in period, and withdrawals are instant. It is crucial to mention that *returns are not guaranteed* and could be revised at any time. At the time of my enrollment, the plan returns were 2.5% p.a. but it has reduced to 1.5% since then. While the current interest rate is relatively low, it still covers inflation[^1]. And it is 1% p.a. more than my bank's account[^2]. 

Other similar options currently available in Singapore:
- [Dash PET](https://dash.com.sg/dashpet) - up to 10k, 1.3% p.a., $0.7 per withdrawal
- [SGF Vivid Savings Account](https://vividcard.sg/) - up to 20k, 1.3%

[^1]: Here, I assume inflation as the [change in consumer price index](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/cpimar2021.pdf).
[^2]: At the time of writing, the interest rate on the first $15,000 in [UOB One Account](https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/chequeing/one-account.page) is 0.25% p.a. but because I credit my salary there, hitting $500 minimal spend results in 0.5% p.a. instead.

### Retirement

Expat life has many benefits but also comes with some downsides. One of such downsides is the necessity to create and execute a retirement plan without any help from the government. Safe nets such as pension (in my previous countries) or CPF in Singapore are not available to foreigners.

I found it is important to start saving up for retirement as early as possible. And that retirement savings is just a form of long-term investing that greatly benefits from the compound effect. Let's look at the example from [MoneySense](https://www.moneysense.gov.sg/articles/2018/10/introduction-to-retirement-planning), a governmental website of Singapore:

> Andy started saving $250 a month 30 years ago while Bob started saving $400 a month 20 years ago. Assume that their investments both grow at 4% a year: 

|                   | Andy | Bob
|-------------------|------|----
| Savings per month | $250 | $400
| When they started | 30 years ago | 20 years ago
| Total saved       | $90,000 | $96,000
| Value today       | $174,000 | $147,198 

Looking at the numbers, it was a no-brainer for me to start investing for the gold years as the number one priority.

##### Looking for the best service

There is an unlimited number of ways how to do that, but I was looking for the following:

- It shouldn't require any prior knowledge as I have never invested before.
- It should be a passive investment because I can't guarantee I will have time or desire to manage it regularly for 30+ years.
- It should provide reasonable returns. (Reasonable here means equals the growth of the global economy on average).
- It should have low fees. For such a long period, even a tiny difference in the fee makes a big difference in the outcome.
- I should be able to adjust the risk level as, again, it is my first investment ever.
- No lock-in

After thorough research, I found a [robo-advisor](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/roboadvisor-roboadviser.asp) is the best fit for me:

- Most robo-advisors provide web and mobile apps with a sleek interface and make the process as simple as possible.
- The robo takes care of fund allocation, automatic rebalancing of the portfolio. All I need to do is to set up an automatic monthly transfer from my bank account.
- The past returns of all robos I have found are very decent and are able to provide 6% p.a. even for a low-risk portfolio.
- There are no instruments with lower fees except DIY investing.

If we get a bit more into details, robos can invest either into [Unit Trusts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unittrust.asp) or [ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp). Each robo-advisor has its own strategy for the algorithms. They can be based on different economic theories and require a different amount of human intervention. But it is a story for another time.

##### My choice

There are many different types of robos in Singapore. And I don't think there is any solution that fits everybody. For me, only two made to the shortlist. [StashAway](https://www.stashaway.sg) and [Syfe](https://www.syfe.com).

I found StashAway's strategy more in line with my preferences. The concept of Risk Index is easy to understand and it gives me the flexibility I was looking for.

Syfe is also an interesting robo, especially since they launched Core portfolios. (It wasn't available at the time I was choosing my platform).

I started with StashAway 18% that generated me ~10% p.a. return to date. I also found I can stomach volatility rather fine and with such a long period of investment, it would make sense to take more risk. That is why I recently increased the risk index to 22% and I might increase it further in the future.

For the latest update on the numbers, see my [investments tracker](/net-worth-tracker) page. It also contains referral links that provide some goodies.

That's all for today. In the next post, I will cover the rest of the instruments I use.
