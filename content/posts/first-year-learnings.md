The first time I got my feet wet with the world of finance and investments was the middle of 2020. But only by the end of the year I really developed my interest and started proactively learning and trying new things. As any student I did mistakes. And today I want to go through some of them.

There are 2 methods to learn something new, [passive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_learning) and [active learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning). Both of them are important and complimentary to each other.

I personally learn much better by doing. With investing it means I have to pay "learning fee" with loses. But for me, it is the only way to really internalize some of the concepts. Playing with small money would hopefully teach me well enough to avoid the same mistakes with big investments.

Below I'm going to list the biggest mistakes I did during the first year of investing with particular examples and takeaways.

### Catching falling knife

I would be financially better if instead of trying to buy "the dip" I would wait until the dust has settled. Examples: BABA, ETH, BTC.

Learning: when volatility starts, it is better to miss on upside. Prices will stabilize or even reverse the direction at some point. That is the time to add more if I still see the investment attractive. Avoiding falling knife doesn't protect from further loses but at least reduce them.

### No strategy for taking profit

For high volatile investments such as growth stocks and crypto I need to always have a plan when and how I take a profit short term even if I want to keep the position for a long time. Examples: SE, BABA, FUTU, ETH & BTC.

Learning: there must be a strategy on what to do when the price increases or decreases rapidly. I need to set target prices at which I would reduce or even close the position on the way up or down. Yes, there is a chance for a position to shoot hundreds percents over years. But even in this case the path there wouldn't be straight. Instead it would have its ups and downs. It is unreasonable to expect that a positions with 50% profit in a week wouldn't have a correction.

### Trading works completely different from investment

I had my small "TOTO" portfolio almost since the beginning. I think it is better to allocate a tiny percentage of the net worth to let myself to try new things, test theories. Or just gamble.

This way there is less temptation to do something risky with the rest of the capital.

A good learning here is that I can't apply the same investment approach to my short-term trades.

Some highlight:

- It doesn't matter how much conviction I have in a position, I need to have stop loses.
- Using DCA wouldn't average the return over time, the position can go close to zero instead.
- Leverage quickly makes it a gambling.

## Takeaway

Passive learning doesn't always work. Just reading a book and general awareness of best practices doesn't make me able to use them appropriately in my own portfolio. What helps me is a direct relation between my action and an outcome.

It takes time and money to get better in anything. Investments is not an exceptions. I did my fair share of mistakes and I'll do more. But it is fine as long as I learn.
