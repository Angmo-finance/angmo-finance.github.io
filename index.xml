&lt;p>In my opinion, the goals should be ambitious to motivate for better results.
At the same time, they must be somewhat close to reality and potentially achievable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I list my current goals in this post.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Investments tracker</title><link>https://angmo-finance.github.io/investments-tracker/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://angmo-finance.github.io/investments-tracker/</guid><description>This page is updated once per month.
I track all small and large investments, split by how I plan to use the funds.
Total amount from all investements: $68,373.32.
Notes:
All numbers are in Singaporean Dollars. 11/06/2020 - the date of the start of my journey. Projected return - either projected number given by a service I use or my conservative estimation. Return value = current balance - (deposits - withdrawals) Annual return - calculated using XIRR on the list of transactions and the current value.</description></item><item><title>Cash accounts</title><link>https://angmo-finance.github.io/posts/cash-accounts/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 12:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://angmo-finance.github.io/posts/cash-accounts/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my previous post, I already touched on the topic of cash accounts while choosing where to keep my emergency fund.

&lt;p>In this blog, I want to share my finance and investment journey as an Ang Mo (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_mo">white person&lt;/a>) in Singapore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might be useful for young foreigners in a similar situation as I am. It could be interesting for the more general public as most of the learnings are universal or it can be read just for laughs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
