Simple return - current balance / deposit Annual return - calculated using XIRR on the list of transactions and the current value.</description></item><item><title>Let's start</title><link>http://angmo-finance.github.io/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:44:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://angmo-finance.github.io/posts/introduction/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello there!&lt;/p>
