Notes:
All numbers are in Singaporean Dollars. 01/07/2020 - the date of the start of my journey. Projected return - either projected number from a service or my conservative estimation. Simple return - current balance / deposit Annual return - calculated using XIRR on the list of transactions and the current value.</description></item><item><title>Let's start</title><link>http://angmo-finance.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:44:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>http://angmo-finance.github.io/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this blog, I want to share my finance and investment journey as an Ang Mo (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_mo">white person&lt;/a>) in Singapore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might be useful for young foreigners in a similar situation as I am, could be interesting for the more general public as most of the learnings are universal or it can be read just for laughs.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
