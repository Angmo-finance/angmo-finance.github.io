At the same time, they must be somewhat close to reality and potentially achievable.</p><p>I list my current financial goals in this post.</p><h3 id=liquid-net-worth>Liquid net worth</h3><p>This section includes any &ldquo;non-locked&rdquo; assets. Mostly they can be withdrawn and redeployed in just a few days.
In particular:</p><ul><li>Saving accounts</li><li>Stocks</li><li>Crypto</li></ul><p>I have just started my investment journey, and I&rsquo;ve planned my route up to S$1,000,000.</p><p>(The table updated in June 2023 the last time)</p><table><thead><tr><th>Year</th><th>Target</th><th>Progress</th><th>Archived on</th><th>Note</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2021</td><td>$50,000.00</td><td>100%</td><td>May 2021</td><td>1 year from ~nothing</td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>$100,000.00</td><td>100%</td><td>Dec 2021</td><td>Accelerated savings</td></tr><tr><td>2023</td><td>$200,000.00</td><td>100%</td><td>Mar 2023</td><td>Despite multiple setbacks</td></tr><tr><td>2024</td><td>$350,000.00</td><td>68.27%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2025</td><td>$500,000.00</td><td>47.79%</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2026</td><td>$1,000,000.00</td><td>23.89%</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>I want to stress that the goals I set myself are very ambitious.
With my current saving rate by 2026, I will have <em>3 times</em> less worth than planned.
That means I&rsquo;ll have to either make much more money, take more risks or adjust the numbers as years pass by.</p><h3 id=family>Family</h3><p><del>I plan to start my own family by <strong>2022</strong>.</del></p><p><del>Not many details here as it is rather personal topic.

And I&rsquo;m expecting to become a father in <strong>2024</strong>.</p><h3 id=housing>Housing</h3><p>Based on my research, it is almost always cheaper to own a house than rent the whole life.
Besides, I would love to be able to modify the place I live in based on my needs and preferences. That is usually not an option when I rent.</p><p>My goal is to have my own house by <strong>2025</strong>.</p><p>The question here is <em>where</em> do I want to settle down.</p><p>From a financial point of view, it should be feasible. I own some real estate back in my home country. I don&rsquo;t draw any interest from it, I use it to help my parents and family. But it should be possible to cover downpayment.</p></div></div></section><section class=section><div class="container has-text-centered"><p>&copy; Yours, Ang Mo, 2021<br><br>The content of this blog shares a personal opinion and experience.
